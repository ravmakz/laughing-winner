#' Calculate a distance matrix comparing samples based on the number of alleles
#' that differ in zygosity.
#' 
#' This function does pairwise comparisons between diploid samples in a genlight
#' object. The number representing the distance between two samples is equal to
#' the number of alleles in the samples that do not have the same zygosity.
#' 
#' @rdname bitwise_distance
#'
#' @param x a genlight object. 
#' 
#' @return Pairwise distances between individuals present in the genlight object.
