#' Calculate a distance matrix comparing samples based on the number of alleles
#' that differ in zygosity.
#' 
#' This function does pairwise comparisons between diploid samples in a genlight
#' object. The number representing the distance between two samples is equal to
#' the number of alleles in the samples that do not have the same zygosity.
#'
#' @name bitwise
#'
#' @param x a genlight object. 
#'
#' @param percent \code{logical}. Should the distance be represented from 0 to 1? 
#' Default set to \code{TRUE}. \code{FALSE} will return the distance represented 
#' as integers from 1 to n where n is the number of loci. 
#'  
#' @param mat \code{logical}. Return a matrix object. Default set to  
#' \code{FALSE}, returning a dist object. \code{TRUE} returns a matrix object. 
#'
#' @param missing_match \code{logical}. Determines whether two samples differing
#' by missing data in a location should be counted as matching at that location.
#' Default set to \code{TRUE}, which forces missing data to match with anything. 
#' \code{FALSE} forces missing data to not match with any other information. 
#'
#' @param threads The maximum number of parallel threads to be used within this
#'   function. A value of 0 (default) will attempt to use as many threads as there
#'   are available cores/CPUs. In most cases this is ideal. A value of 1 will force
#'   the function to run serially, which may increase stability on some systems.
#'   Other values may be specified, but should be used with caution.
#'
#' 
#' @return Pairwise distances between individuals present in the genlight object.

#' Calculates and returns a vector of Pgen values for the given genlight object.
#' Each element represents the probability that the individual at that element
#' would have been produced via random mating using estimates derived from the
#' genotypes present in the genlight object.
#'
#' @rdname bitwise
#'
#' @param x a genlight object. 
#' 
#' @param percent a \code{logical} to determine whether the values should be returned
#'  as percentages or logarithms of percentages. \code{FALSE} is the default, and 
#'  returns the logarithmic values rather than the percentage values. This option has
#'  a much larger range and is highly recommended. \code{TRUE} returns the percentage
#'  chance for each genotype to be produced via random mating, rather than the log
#'  equivalent.
#' 
#' @return A vector containing one Pgen value for each genotype in the genlight object.
