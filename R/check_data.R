#' Check for samples that are incomparable due to missing data
#'
#'
#' If two samples share no loci typed in common, they are incomparable and will
#' produce missing data in a distance matrix, which could lead to problems with
#' further analyses. This function finds these samples and returns a matrix of
#' how many other samples these are incomparable with.

#' @param gid a genind or genclone object

#' # These two populations have no samples that are incomparable

#' # If you reduce the number of loci, we find that there are 
#' # incomparable samples.
