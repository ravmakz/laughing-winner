#' Check for samples with incompatible missing data
#'
#'
#' If two samples share no loci typed in common, they are incomparable and will
#' produce missing data in a distance matrix, which could lead to problems with
#' further analyses. This function finds these samples and returns a matrix of
#' how many other samples these are incompatible with.
