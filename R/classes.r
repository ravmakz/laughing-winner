#' Genclone class
#' 
#' Genclone is an S4 class that extends the \code{\linkS4class{genind}}
#' from the \emph{\link{adegenet}} package. It will have all of the same
#' attributes as the \code{\linkS4class{genind}}, but it will contain two
#' extra slots that will help retain information about population hierarchies
#' and multilocus genotypes.
#' 
#' @section Extends: 
#' Class \code{"\linkS4class{genind}"}, directly.
#' 
#' @details The genclone class will allow for more optimized methods of clone
#' correcting and analyzing data over multiple levels of population hierarchy.
#' 
#' Previously, for hierarchical analysis to work in a \code{\link{genind}}
#' object, the user had to place a data frame in the \code{\link{other}} slot of
#' the object. The suggested name of the data frame was 
#' \code{population_hierarchy}, and this was used to be able to store the
#' hierarchical information inside the object so that the user did not have to
#' keep track of that information. This method worked, but it became apparent
#' that this method of doing things became a bit confusing to the user as the
#' method for changing the population of an object became:
#' 
#' \code{pop(object) <- other(object)$population_hierarchy$population_name}
#' 
#' That is a lot to keep track of. The new \strong{\code{hierarchy}} slot will
#' allow the user to change the population factor with one function and a formula:
#' 
#' \code{setpop(object) <- ~Population/Subpopulation}
#' 
#' making this become slightly more intuitive and tractable.
#' 
#' Previously for \linkS4class{genind} objects, multilocus genotypes were not
#' retained after a data set was subset by population. The new 
#' \strong{\code{mlg}} slot allows us to assign the multilocus genotypes and 
#' retain that information no matter how we subset the data set.
#' 
#' @name genclone-class
#' @rdname genclone-class
#' @aliases genclone
#' @export
#' @slot mlg a vector representing multilocus genotypes for the data set.
#' @slot hierarchy a data frame containing hierarchical levels.
