#==============================================================================#
# This file will contain deprecated functions, namely hierarchy methods. They
# are here for backwards compatibility with poppr 1.1, but will strongly warn
# the user against them.
#==============================================================================#
#' DEPRECATED FUNCTIONS
#' 
#' These functions are deprecated as of \pkg{poppr} version 2.0 and have been 
#' moved to the \pkg{adegenet} package. See \code{\link[adegenet]{strata}} for 
#' details.
#' 
#' @param ... arguments to be passed on to adegenet 
#'   \code{\link[adegenet]{strata}} and \code{\link[adegenet]{setPop}} methods.
#' @param value argument passed on to adegenet methods.
#'   
#' @return a deprecation message and the same return as the adegenet methods.
#'   
#' @section Background:
#'   These functions originally appeared in \pkg{poppr} in July of 2014. In
#'   March 2015, a request was made for them to be ported to the \pkg{adegenet}
#'   package as part of the population genetics in R hackathon. The name of the
#'   functions were moved from "hierarchy" to "strata" because it better
#'   reflected the nature of the fields to contain any information possible.
#'   
#' @seealso \code{\link[adegenet]{strata}} \code{\link[adegenet]{setPop}}
#' @rdname deprecated
