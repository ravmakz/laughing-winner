#' Display a greyscale gradient adjusted to specific parameters
#' 
#' This function has one purpose. It is for deciding the appropriate scaling for
#' a grey palette to be used for edge weights of a minimum spanning network.
#' 
#' @param glim "grey limit". Two numbers between zero and one. They determine 
#' the upper and lower limits for the \code{\link{gray}} function. Default is 0
#' (black) and 0.8 (20\% black). 
#' 
#' @param gadj "grey adjust". a positive \code{integer} greater than zero that
#' will serve as the exponent to the edge weight to scale the grey value to
#' represent that weight.
#' 
#' @param gweight "grey weight". an \code{integer}. If it's 1, the grey scale
#' will be weighted to emphasize the differences between closely related nodes.
#' If it is 2, the grey scale will be weighted to emphasize the differences
#' between more distantly related nodes. 
#' 
#' @return A plot displaying a grey gradient from 0.001 to 1 with minimum and 
#' maximum values displayed as yellow lines, and an equation for the correction 
#' displayed in red. 
#' 
#' @author Zhian N. Kamvar
#'
#' @examples
#' # Normal grey curve with an adjustment of 3, an upper limit of 0.8, and
#' # weighted towards smaller values.
#' greycurve()
#' \dontrun{
#' # 1:1 relationship grey curve.
#' greycurve(gadj=1, glim=1:0)
#' 
#' # Grey curve weighted towards larger values.
#' greycurve(gweight=2)
#' 
#' # Same as the first, but the limit is 1.
#' greycurve(glim=1:0)
#' 
#' # Setting the lower limit to 0.1 and weighting towards larger values.

#' Calculate a distance matrix based on relative dissimilarity
#' 
#' diss.dist uses the same discreet dissimilarity matrix utilized by the index
#' of association (see \code{\link{ia}} for details). It returns a distance
#' reflecting a ratio of the number of observed differences by the number of
#' possible differences. Eg. two individuals who share half of the same alleles
#' will have a distance of 0.5. This function can analyze distances for any
#' marker system.
#' 
#' @param x a \code{\link{genind}} object. 
#' 
#' @param diff \code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, this will count the number of
#' differences between individuals. \code{FALSE} will count the number of 
#' similarities. Default set to \code{TRUE}
#' 
#' @param frac \code{logical}. Should the distance be represented from 0 to 1?
#' Default set to \code{TRUE}. \code{FALSE} will return the distance represented
#' as integers from 1 to n where n is the number of loci*ploidy.
#' 
#' @param mat \code{logical}. Return a matrix object. Default set to 
#' \code{FALSE}, returning a dist object. \code{TRUE} returns a matrix object.
#' 
#' @return Pairwise distances between individuals present in the genind object.
#' @author Zhian N. Kamvar
#'
#' @examples
#' 
#' # A simple example. Let's analyze the mean distance among populations of A.
#' # euteiches.
#' 
#' data(Aeut)
#' mean(diss.dist(popsub(Aeut, 1)))
#' \dontrun{
