#' Calculate a distance matrix based on relative dissimilarity
#' 
#' diss.dist uses the same discreet dissimilarity matrix utilized by the index
#' of association (see \code{\link{ia}} for details). It returns a distance
#' reflecting a ratio of the number of observed differences by the number of
#' possible differences. Eg. two individuals who share half of the same alleles
#' will have a distance of 0.5. This function can analyze distances for any
#' marker system.
#' 
#' @param x a \code{\link{genind}} object. 
#' 
#' @param diff \code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, this will count the number of
#' differences between individuals. \code{FALSE} will count the number of 
#' similarities. Default set to \code{TRUE}
#' 
#' @param frac \code{logical}. Should the distance be represented from 0 to 1?
#' Default set to \code{TRUE}. \code{FALSE} will return the distance represented
#' as integers from 1 to n where n is the number of loci*ploidy.
#' 
#' @param mat \code{logical}. Return a matrix object. Default set to 
#' \code{FALSE}, returning a dist object. \code{TRUE} returns a matrix object.
#' 
#' @return Pairwise distances between individuals present in the genind object.
