# Distance Matrix Storage Function
#
# Helper function used to store data between function calls.
#
# @param v used in \code{.last.value$set(v)} to store object v
# 
# @return a list like \code{.last.value.dist} and
#  \code{.last.value.param} with attributes $set(v) and $get()
#  which store data globally, allowing access between function calls.
#
# Public functions utilizing this function:
# # mlg.filter
#
# Internal functions utilizing this function:
# # none
