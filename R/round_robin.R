#' Round Robin Multilocus Genotypes
#' 
#' This function will mask each locus one by one and then calculate multilocus
#' genotypes from the remaining loci in a round-robin fashion. This is used for
#' calculating the round robin allele frequencies for pgen and psex.
#' 
#' @param gid a genind, genclone, or loci object.
#' 
#' @author Zhian N. Kamvar, Jonah C. Brooks, Stacey Hatfield
#' 
#' @return a matrix of multilocus genotype assignments by masked locus. There 
#'   will be n rows and m columns where n = number of samples and m = number of
#'   loci.
