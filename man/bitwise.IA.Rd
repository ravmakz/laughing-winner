\title{Calculate the index of association between samples in a genlight object.}
\usage{
bitwise.IA(x, indices = NULL, threads = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a genlight object.}

\item{indices}{A vector of integers indicating which loci should be
  sampled while calculating the index of association. If NULL (default),
  all loci will be used.}

\item{threads}{The maximum number of parallel threads to be used within this
  function. A value of 0 (default) will attempt to use as many threads as there
  are available cores/CPUs. In most cases this is ideal. A value of 1 will force
  the function to run serially, which may increase stability on some systems.
  Other values may be specified, but should be used with caution.}
}
\value{
Index of association representing the samples in this genlight object.
