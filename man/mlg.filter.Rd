\usage{
mlg.stats(pop, threshold = 2^53, missing = "mean", memory = FALSE,
  algorithm = "farthest_neighbor", distance = "nei.dist", threads = 0,
  stats = "ALL", ...)

mlg.filter(pop, threshold = 0, missing = "mean", memory = FALSE,
  algorithm = "farthest_neighbor", distance = "nei.dist", threads = 0,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{a \code{\linkS4class{genind}} or \code{\linkS4class{genclone}} object.}

\item{threshold}{the desired minimum distance between distinct genotypes.
Defaults to 0, which will only merge identical genotypes}

\item{missing}{any method to be used by \code{\link{missingno}}: "mean"
(default), "zero", "loci", "genotype", or "ignore".}

\item{memory}{whether this function should remember the last distance matrix
it generated. TRUE will attempt to reuse the last distance matrix
if the other parameters are the same. (default) FALSE will ignore any stored
matrices and not store any it generates.}

\item{algorithm}{determines the type of clustering to be done.
(default) "farthest_neighbor" merges clusters based on the maximum distance
between points in either cluster. This is the strictest of the three.
"nearest_neighbor" merges clusters based on the minimum distance between
points in either cluster. This is the loosest of the three.
"average_neighbor" merges clusters based on the average distance between
every pair of points between clusters.}

\item{distance}{a character or function defining the distance to be applied
to pop. Defaults to \code{\link{nei.dist}}. A matrix or table containing
distances between individuals (such as the output of \code{\link{nei.dist}})
is also accepted for this parameter.}

\item{threads}{The maximum number of parallel threads to be used within this
function. A value of 0 (default) will attempt to use as many threads as there
are available cores/CPUs. In most cases this is ideal. A value of 1 will force
the function to run serially, which may increase stability on some systems.
Other values may be specified, but should be used with caution.}

\item{stats}{determines which statistics this function should return on cluster
mergers. If "MLGs", this function will return a vector of cluster
assignments, similar to that of \code{\link{mlg.vector}}. If "thresholds",
the threshold at which each cluster was merged will be returned instead of
the cluster assignment. "distances" will return a distance matrix of the new
distances between each new cluster. If "sizes", the size of each remaining
cluster will be returned. Finally, "all" (default) will return a list of all 4.}

\item{...}{any parameters to be passed off to the distance method.}
}
\value{
\subsection{mlg.stats} {
a numeric vector naming the multilocus genotype of each individual in
the dataset. Each genotype is at least the specified distance apart, as
calculated by the selected algorithm. If stats is set to \code{TRUE}, this
function will return the thresholds had which each cluster merger occured
instead of the new cluster assignments.
}

\subsection{mlg.filter}{
a \link{genclone} object with the mll field updated to contain a numeric
vector naming the suspected multilocus lineage of each individual in
the dataset. Each lineage is at least the specified distance apart, as
calculated by the selected algorithm.
}
}
\description{
mlg.filter
}
\note{
Thresholds or distances greater than 2^53 may produce unexpected results.

\code{mlg.filter} makes use of \code{mlg.vector} grouping prior to
applying the given threshold. Therefore \code{mlg.vector} and
\code{mlg.vector} return the same vector when threshold is set to 0 or less.
