  // This function uses various clustering algorithms to
  // condense a set of multilocus genotypes into a potentially smaller
  // set. Clusters closer than threshold apart will be merged together,
  // and the process will repeat until no remaining clusters are close
  // enough to be merged. Farthest Neighbor clustering is the strictest,
  // (clustering only groups whose extremes are nearest) and is therefore 
  // used as the default. Nearest Neighbor is the least strict, and is
  // prone to linking vastly different individuals into the same cluster
  // if there is a path between them. Average Neighbor takes the average
  // distance between all pairs of points in two clusters, then merges
  // the pair of clusters with the smallest average distance.

  // Note: Input validation is handled in the R wrapper function.
  //  Take care if calling this function directly.
