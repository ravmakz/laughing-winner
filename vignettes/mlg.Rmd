# Abstract

A multilocus genotype is a unique combination of alleles across two or more
loci. For organisms such as plant pathogens that often reproduce clonally,
multilocus genotypes are invaluable for identifying the mode and spread of an
organism. This document will describe in detail how you can define multilocus
genotypes/lineages and how you can use them for your analyses of both genclone
and snpclone objects.

# Introduction


# Multilocus Genotype Flavors

There are three different ways for constructing multilocus genotypes in *poppr*.

| Method | Description |
|----|----|
| `"original"` | Default MLG definition; strict matching |
| `"contracted"` | Collapsing MLGs by genetic distance with `mlg.filter` |
| `"custom"` | User-defined multilocus genotypes  |

The first is a simply naïve construction where all alleles must match to make a
unique multilocus genotype. New in version 2.0 is the ability to use genetic
distance to collapse multilocus genotypes or define custom multilocus lineages
based on other information. You can use the function `mll()` to display and
switch between different multilocus genotypes/lineages.

```{r, warning = TRUE}
library("poppr")
data(monpop)
monpop
head(mll(monpop, "original"), 20) # Showing the definitions for the first 20 samples
```

Notice how we got a warning. This is because the `monpop` data set was created
before `mll()` was implemented. Luckily, this warning gives us information on 
how to fix it.

```{r}
mll(monpop) <- "original"
monpop
```

We can see that the description says 
`r gsub("original", "**original**", capture.output(monpop)[6])`. This is how we
know what the current MLG definition is for our object. Let' see what happens
when we change it.

```{r}
mll(monpop) <- "custom"
monpop
```

Now it says `r gsub("custom", "**custom**", capture.output(monpop)[6])`. Of 
course, if we look at the MLGs, we will see that they appear to be the same as
our original definition:

```{r}
head(mll(monpop, "custom"), 20) # Showing the definitions for the first 20 samples
```



All of these functions will work for both **genclone** and **snpclone** objects.
In this section, we will demonstrate how to construct each of these three
multilocus genotype definitions in different data sets.

## Naïve ("original")

This is the default way *poppr* calculates multilocus genotypes. You see it
immediately when you load a genclone object. Let's use the example `monpop` from
`r citep(bib["everhart2014finescale"])`. First, we need to reset the data to
our original MLGs.

```{r}
mll(monpop) <- "original"
monpop
```

You notice that there are 694 samples, yet only 264 multilocus genotypes in the 
data set over 13 loci. In this sub-section, I will demonstrate how these MLGs
are constructed.

The naïve definition simply takes strings of alleles and compares them for
equality. This method is quick and easily interpretable, but means that things
like genotyping error, hyper-variable loci, and missing data all contribute to a
unique genotype that might not be truly unique `r citep(bib["kamvar2015novel"])`.

To give an example, let's imagine that we have five samples with alleles typed
at two loci. 

```{r}
grid_example <- matrix(c(1, 4,
                         1, 1,
                         5, 1,
                         9, 1,
                         9, 4), 
                       ncol = 2,
                       byrow = TRUE)
rownames(grid_example) <- LETTERS[1:5]
colnames(grid_example) <- c("x", "y")
grid_example
```

We notice how they all have different multilocus genotypes. Indeed, if we 
analyze them, we see that there are five multilocus genotypes.

```{r}
library("poppr")
x <- as.genclone(df2genind(grid_example, ploidy = 1))
tab(x)  # Look at the multilocus genotype table
nmll(x) # count the number of multilocus genotypes
mll(x)  # show the multilocus genotype definitions
```

What we did above was to analyze the **tab** slot of the object showing the
counts of alleles per sample across the two loci. We can clearly see by eye that
no two samples are alike. The `nmll()` function counts the **n**umber of
**m**ulti**l**ocus **l**ineages in the sample. the `mll()` function displays the
assignment of the multilocus lineages in the sample.

> Note: we used `mll()` to show us our multilocus lineages. Later on, we will
> use this same function to switch between different definitions. See ?mll for
> details.

Now let's say we included another sample with partial missing data. Let's say it
was typed as allele "5" at the **x** locus, but missing the allele at the **y**
locus.

```{r}
x <- as.genclone(df2genind(rbind(grid_example, new = c(5, NA)), ploidy = 1))
tab(x)  # Note the missing data at locus 2. 
nmll(x)
mll(x)
```

Now we see that we have 6 multilocus genotypes even though one of them contains
missing data.

Let's also imagine that we included yet another sample that had a low-frequency
allele at locus **y**, 2, but had the allele "5" at locus **x**.

```{r}
grid_new <- rbind(grid_example, 
                  new = c(5, NA), 
                  mut = c(5, 2)
                  )
x <- as.genclone(df2genind(grid_new, ploidy = 1))
tab(x)
nmll(x)
mll(x)
```

Again, we get completely different genotypes, but notice how the genotypes we 
added are closer to the genotype that shares the 5 allele. The reason this 
happens is because the naïve algorithm reports the rank of the concatenated 
alleles like so:

```{r}
(xt <- apply(tab(x), 1, paste, collapse = ""))
rank(xt, ties.method = "first")
```

Even though we have reason to believe that the samples "new" and "mut" might
actually have the genotype x.5 and y.1 (the MLG of sample C), the algorithm sees
them as different. If we calculate the pairwise euclidean distances between
samples, we see that "new", "mut" and, "C" are very similar to each other:

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
library("phangorn")
raw_dist <- function(x){
  dist(genind2df(x, usepop = FALSE))
}
(xdis <- raw_dist(x))
plot.phylo(upgma(xdis))
```

Therefore, we might want to consider "new", "mut" and, "C" to be the same MLG.
In the next section, you will see how to collapse multilocus genotypes by
genetic distance.

## Filtered ("contracted")

To remedy the issues with a naïve definition of multilocus genotypes, we can
utilize genetic distance, which will allow us to collapse multilocus genotypes
that are under a specific distance threshold. The main function we will use in
this section is `mlg.filter()`. By default, it will calculate Nei's genetic
distance `r citep(bib[c("nei1972genetic")])` on the data and then filter based
off of that matrix. You can also utilize your own supplied distance matrix or
distance function.

### Collapsing

Let's continue our example by using the euclidean distance of the raw alleles.
To do the collapsing, we will use the function `mlg.filter()`. 

```{r}
mlg.filter(x, distance = xdis, threshold = 1)
```

Notice that we now have the last two MLGs collapsed together into one MLL. 
Unfortunately, we wanted to collapse three MLGs. What happened?

Remember that the distance between "mut" and "C" was 1. We need to set the 
threshold above where we want the collapse to happen. In order to do this, we
should add a tiny number to the threshold:

```{r}
(e <- .Machine$double.eps^0.5) # A very tiny number
mlg.filter(x, distance = xdis, threshold = 1 + e)
```


### Minimum spanning networks

Now we have all of our MLGs collapsed together, but perhaps a better way to 
visualize it would be to use `poppr.msn()`: 

```{r}
# Threshold of 1
set.seed(9001)
g1 <- poppr.msn(x, xdis, threshold = 1, include.ties = TRUE, 
                vertex.label.color = "firebrick", vertex.label.font = 2)
# Threshold of 1 + e
set.seed(9001)
g2 <- poppr.msn(x, xdis, threshold = 1 + e, include.ties = TRUE, 
                vertex.label.color = "firebrick", vertex.label.font = 2)
```

Notice how the genotypes collapse into a single node. Both `poppr.msn()` and
`bruvo.msn()` will calculate and plot these minimum spanning networks. 

### Setting the genotypes

If we wanted to reassign our sample genotypes to the collapsed version, all
we would have to do is use the `mlg.filter()` commands above, but use the `<-` 
operator to specify the threshold. Note that I will be using `mlg.table()` to show
the distribution of the multilocus genotypes before and after filtering.

```{r}
x
mlg.table(x) # Before: 7 MLGs
mlg.filter(x, distance = xdis) <- 1 + e
x
mlg.table(x) # After: 5 MLGs
```

Notice how the information you see has changed. You can see that it's printed
out that you have 5 **contracted** multilocus genotypes, but you have some
cryptic code underneath:

| symbol | meaning |
|:----:|:----|
| **[t]** | threshold |
| **[d]** | distance (can be matrix or function) |
| **[a]** | algorithm (see the next section) |

Genclone and snpclone objects will always remember what parameters were used for
filtering multilocus genotypes, but the only catch is that, if you use your own
supplied distance (matrix or function), you must be very careful not to delete
it or change the object name.

This means that you don't always have to specify the distance when assigning a
threshold:

```{r}
mlg.filter(x) <- 4.51
x
mlg.table(x)
```

> DANGER! DANGER! While this is a convenient function, if you use a matrix or
> function that was created by you, you **must not delete it or change its name**. 
> Only the name of the matrix/function is stored, so if you delete the
> matrix/function used to inform your filtering, you will get an error:

```{r, errors = TRUE}
rm(xdis) # NOOOOOO!
try(mlg.filter(x) <- 1 + e)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cat(" Error: cannot evaluate distance function, it might be missing.")
```

Basically, your object thinks that there should be a matrix called **xdis**, but
it can't find it anywhere. But don't worry, we can restore it if we have the
function available. We will use the `raw_dist()` function that we defined
earlier.

```{r}
mlg.filter(x, distance = raw_dist) <- 1 + e
x
```

The safest way, perhaps, is to use a function defined in *poppr*. For example,
we'll use Bruvo's distance since it takes into account the real value of the
alleles `r citep(bib["Bruvo:2004"])`.

> The arguments to your distance function will be stored in the object as well!

```{r}
bruvo.dist(x, replen = c(1, 1))
mlg.filter(x, distance = bruvo.dist, replen = c(1, 1)) <- 0.44
x
```

Of course, our multilocus genotypes are not changed forever, they are
just stored in a different place. We can access the original, naïve multilocus
genotypes by using the `mll()` function:

```{r}
mll(x, "original")
mll(x) # contracted
mll(x) <- "original"
mll(x) # original
```

### Tie breakers (algorithms)

Underlying `mlg.filter` are three algorithms that decide what genotypes go
together `r citep(bib["kamvar2015novel"])`:

 - nearest neighbor
 - farthest neighbor (default)
 - average neighbor (UPGMA)

You can specify which algorithm you want to use in clustering with the
`algorithm` argument. Each of these algorithms have different behaviors when it
comes to collapsing multilocus genotypes. In short, farthest neighbor is the
most conservative, nearest neighbor can have a chaining effect, and average
neighbor is somewhere in between. Your choice of algorithm really depends on 
the biology of your organism.

To help visualize this, there is the function `filter_stats()`, which will plot
the output of the filtering algorithm. For simplicity, we will use the `Pinf`
data set. 

```{r}
data(Pinf)
Pinf
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
pinfreps <- c(2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2)
pinf_filtered <- filter_stats(Pinf, distance = bruvo.dist, replen = pinfreps, plot = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
pinf_filtered <- structure(list(farthest = structure(list(THRESHOLDS = c(0.00946969696969697,

```

We can see that the different algorithms behave quite differently. 

## Custom ("custom")

Sometimes multilocus genotypes are defined by more than just genetic data and it
would be useful to be able to analyze these genotype definitions. Luckily,
there is a way to do this. *Poppr* has support for custom multilocus genotypes.
For example, we have a simulated data set that has 50 samples with 26 multilocus
genotypes. 

```{r}
data(partial_clone)
pc <- as.genclone(partial_clone)
mll(pc)
```

Let's change the MLGs to letters instead of numbers. We will use `mll.custom()`
to do this.

```{r}
LETTERS[mll(pc)]  # The new MLGs
mll.custom(pc) <- LETTERS[mll(pc)]
mlg.table(pc)
```

This even works with minimum spanning networks:

```{r}
pcpal <- colorRampPalette(c("blue", "gold"))
set.seed(9001)
pcmsn <- bruvo.msn(pc, replen = rep(1, nLoc(pc)), palette = pcpal,
                   vertex.label.color = "firebrick", vertex.label.font = 2,
                   vertex.label.cex = 1.5)
``` 

Let's say that we realized that we have strong evidence for MLG "Q" being the
same as MLG "M". If we wanted to change those, we could simply change the
factor levels:

```{r}
mll.levels(pc)[mll.levels(pc) == "Q"] <- "M"
```

And we can plot again

```{r}
set.seed(9001)
pcmsn <- bruvo.msn(pc, replen = rep(1, nLoc(pc)), palette = pcpal,
                   vertex.label.color = "firebrick", vertex.label.font = 2,
                   vertex.label.cex = 1.5)
```

Notice how the minimum spanning network architecture stayed the same, but the
labels had changed. 

# Diversity Analysis

In the **Data Import and Manipulation** vignette, the first command demonstrated
was the `poppr()`, command, which produced a table of diversity statistics, most
of which were calculated on counts of multilocus genotypes. These statistics can
be replicated by using the function `diversity_stats()`. This function
calculates diversity statistics based off of a table of multilocus genotypes.
Let's analyze the diversity of the peach brown rot pathogen, *Monilinia
fructicola*, structured by Symptom (Fruit Rot:FR and Blossom Blight:BB) and Year
`r citep(bib["everhart2014finescale"])`. Let's first look at the distribution of
multilocus genotypes:

```{r}
data(monpop)
splitStrata(monpop) <- ~Tree/Year/Symptom
montab <- mlg.table(monpop, strata = ~Symptom/Year)
```

We can see from these plots that the Fruit Rot (FR) have a lot more clones in
the canopies than Blossom Blight (BB). This makes biological sense since Fruit
Rot infections are clonally propagated, whereas Blossom Blight infections are
from sexual propagules `r citep(bib["everhart2014finescale"])`. Let's look at
the diversity metrics.

## Basic Statistics

The function `diversity_stats()` is used to get basic diversity statistics:

```{r}
(monstat <- diversity_stats(montab))
```

## Confidence Intervals

We can get confidence intervals for these statistics using `diversity_ci()`:

```{r, message = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
diversity_ci(montab, n = 100L, raw = FALSE)
```

You can see that there was a warning about centering the confidence interval.
The boxplots you see are the distribution of the bootstrapped replicates, but
they are known to be biased. We invite users to please read the documentation
for `diversity_ci()` by typing `?diversity_ci`. It is very important to be careful
when interpreting these results because sometimes confidence the confidence
intervals exist outside of the possible range, as exemplified by 
`r paste(rownames(monstat)[monstat[, "E.5"] > 0.9], collapse = " and ")`.

## Custom Statistics

In all of the `diversity_*` functions, you can use your own custom diversity
statistics. A common one we get requests for is the clonal fraction,
$\frac{MLG}{N}$ or the number of multilocus genotypes over the number of
samples. You can add it in by writing your own function. Keep in mind, that you
should write it for both a matrix and a vector of counts if you want to be able
to bootstrap it.

```{r}
myCF <- function(x){
 x <- drop(as.matrix(x))
 if (length(dim(x)) > 1){ # if it's a matrix
   res <- rowSums(x > 0)/rowSums(x)
 } else {                 # if it's a vector
   res <- sum(x > 0)/sum(x)
 }
 return(res)
}
(monstat2 <- diversity_stats(montab, CF = myCF))
```

You can use filtered or custom MLGs to compare diversity. Here, I'm filtering
genotypes in `monpop` that are different by only a single mutational step 
`r citep(bib["Bruvo:2004"])`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Repeat lengths are necessary
reps <- c(CHMFc4 = 7, CHMFc5 = 2, CHMFc12 = 4, 
          SEA = 4, SED = 4, SEE = 2, SEG = 6,
          SEI = 3, SEL = 4, SEN = 2, 
          SEP = 4, SEQ = 2, SER = 4)

# Adding a little bit, so the threshold is included.
e <- .Machine$double.eps^0.5

# Using the default farthest neighbor algorithm to collapse genotypes
mlg.filter(monpop, distance = bruvo.dist, replen = reps) <- (0.5/13) + e
montabf <- mlg.table(monpop, strata = ~Symptom/Year)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}

)
monpop@mlg@mlg$contracted <- filts
mll(monpop) <- "contracted"
montabf <- mlg.table(monpop, strata = ~Symptom/Year)
```

```{r}
(monstatf <- diversity_stats(montabf, CF = myCF))
monstat2 - monstatf # Take the difference from the unfiltered
```

We can see that filtered MLLs tend to be less diverse. This makes intuitive
sense as it is creating larger classes of multilocus genotypes.

```{r}
mll(monpop) <- "original"
```

## Jack-knife rarefaction

The function `diversity_ci()` and `diversity_boot()` have the option to perform
jack knife rarefaction calculations. This means that your data will be randomly
sub-sampled to either the smallest population size, or whatever is specified
in the parameter `n.rare`, whichever is bigger. Here's an example with the
previous data set:

```{r, message = TRUE}
(monrare <- diversity_ci(montab, n = 100L, rarefy = TRUE, raw = FALSE))
```

This can give you comparable estimates of diversity when not all samples are of 
equal size.

# Clone Correction

Clone-correction works hierarchically and only uses the first MLG copy
encountered in the data per population. This is straightforward for naïve MLGs,
but for MLLs collapsed by genetic distance or custom MLLs, this might change the
results very slightly. As an example, let's look at the `monpop` filtered
MLLs that we created earlier.

```{r}
nmll(monpop, "original")
nmll(monpop, "contracted")
mll(monpop) <- "contracted"
```

To show how the order of the samples can affect the sampling, we will take the
sum of all pairwise distances between clone-corrected samples (corrected without
respect to populations):

```{r}
mcc <- clonecorrect(monpop, strata = NA)
sum(dist(mcc))
```

Now, what happens when we randomly sample individuals?

```{r}
set.seed(999)
mcc1 <- clonecorrect(monpop[sample(nInd(monpop))], strata = NA)
sum(dist(mcc1))

set.seed(1000)
mcc2 <- clonecorrect(monpop[sample(nInd(monpop))], strata = NA)
sum(dist(mcc2))
```

Notice how we are getting different results based on the order of samples. This
does not mean that the procedure doesn't work, it just means that we must be
careful when clone-correcting modified multilocus genotypes. 

# Conclusions

We have demonstrated here new methods for treating multilocus genotypes on
microsatellite data, but it is important to remember that all of these functions
can work with any source of data stored in either a **genclone** or **snpclone**
(derived from **genlight**) object. Especially with `mlg.filter()`, these new
functions will allow for a more flexible analysis of WGS data of clonal
organisms where true clones may differ by more than a few
mutations/errors/missing data. As with all analyses, it is important to
understand the algorithms used and take them into account when interpreting
results.
